My submission for my LBYCPA1 class, wherein I had to make something useful using Python. Since I already knew a couple of languages like HTML, CSS, and JS I wanted to also integrate those languages into this project. Through this, I was able to to practice my Python skills while also being able to hone my skills in the other languages.
